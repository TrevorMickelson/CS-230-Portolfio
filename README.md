## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client Creative Technology Solutions wanted me to design their game software and have it work on the web.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I clearly answered all of the questions, and the pros and cons of using different operating systems/programming languages.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I personally felt that the documentation was more for the client than it was for me, it wasn't all that userful for me when developing.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I could probably improve my recomenations section. I say this because I don't feel that I went into enough depth for a geniune client to utilize.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Well the users needs is all that matters when writing software, but it should also be taken with a grain of salt. Requirements change constantly, so the design 
was written with this taken into consideration.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I always anlyaize designing software the same. What are the requirements, what's the probability of change, how much is being asked of me, and does it need to scale?
I would use all of these questions/strategies when designing any software in the future as well. Code that doesn't need to scale is much simpler than code that needs to scale. 
Ultimately it always just depends on the situation.
